This app allows you to make a story by first asking random nouns, colors, jobs, etc. It remembers where you are when you change the state (from portret to landscape.) If the story you made is too long to fit on the page, you'll be able to scroll the textview and read the end of your story.


Examples on my phone (a Lenovo C2)
